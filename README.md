# MANI : The Shy High 5 Machine
Mani is a hand that is not fond of physical contact, and avoids any attempt at a high 5. This code controls the two servos that allow him to dodge your hand, based on the input from an infrared sensor.

This was the code for my DE2 Gizmo (Physical Computing) project, which consisted in creating a machine that demonstrated an engaging physical interaction.

This project uses the VarSpeedServo library by NETLab Toolkit Group: https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/VarSpeedServo
